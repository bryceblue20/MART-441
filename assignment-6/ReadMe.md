this was by-far the most complicated script set I had to make, utilizing JSONS, arrays, randomnumbers, localStorage and the very strong utilization of variables for said JSON. The storage capabilites of such new JS mechanics went without a hitch for the most part,having to just psy close attention to how it all connected and related to each other, but for a couple days at the most I had difficulties with uneven spawning of images, sometimes revealing multiple duplicates messing up the flow of matches and ultimately screwing up the allFound from the code! I messed with the variable count multiple times assuming the issue lied with that, but ultimately the solution was to add the correct amount of matches to the count[randomnumber] to get the correct amount of images in my large random image array to spawn. Finally, I really wanted to be able to style the body tags of all three HTMLs but for whatever reason I wasn't able to. Nevertheless despite these issues I feel this is an excellent evolution to the memory game starting point I made in Week 5!
