I found this assignment to be a simultaneously frustrating and enlightening experience, due to having to constantly refresh 
my memory from past assignments from previous web design courses, and re-teach myself the functions of divs and how to properly 
organize them so they can function properly, as well as to have images appropriately respond and adapt to browser window size.
I am actually proud of what I managed to make as it is honestly one of my better looking sites i created completely from scratch
without the aid of apps such as Dreamweaver or the like. Within is a static site about me as a person, as a nature and art
conniseur, as well as where I am currently at in my college career!
