For this project I wanted to try something a bit unique by using a new css property that allows me to give the background an image. I needed to experiment and research to get it to work but it now functions beautifully in that regard. I then decided to take advantage of how the foreground element was positioned to position the title, button (btnSubmit), input (answer) directly opposite of it to give it an appealing organized composition. (Although I cannot figure out how to center the input box, I tried everything but it stuck to the left no matter what) I learned some new HTML tricks to make it look more professional, including a text shadow to help the bottom text stand out from the white background, styled up the input and button a bit with CSS, and added some custom duFont fonts! This is the best looking HTML content I ever created, and glad to see there is some visible growth and the last few html/css classes I took weren't wasted!
