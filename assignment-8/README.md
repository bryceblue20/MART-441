Not only is this by-far the largest project thus far this semester in terms of the amount of syntax, but it also took the most amount of experimentation time to get everything working intentionally. My largest set-back this week is using the pre-existing array set-up in this week's example to create an automatic slideshow that fades in an out after a set-time. I had to create a different strategy from scratch in order to create a functional fadeIn and fadeOut array, utilizing two functions, with one working as the "timer" with a Slider countdown. I also found the jquery code works better when drawing from an html ID or class then from the OOP language and example array, and that functions work best to create animation 'loops' such as the shapes bouncing up and down continuously or the infinite fadeIn and fadeOut of my array. I do wish my bouncing shapes fit in better with a smaller window size, and even though it pushed my mental fortitude to its limit I eventually enjoyed this assignment once I began to understand it!
