This week was by far the most challenging, not only because of a sudden shift into a different writing process for the language of Javascript, but because I misunderstood the assignment requirements and had to re-work a lot of work. The most challenging aspect of this assignment is figuring out how to create objects that not only hold text, but images as well, taking quite a white to realize it is much simpler then I thought, once I understood the mechanics of the 'toString' method and the fact more then one object could be inserted into it, feeling quite embarrassed it took so long to figure out! I first used an extra math.random element to create an ImageArray that corresponds with the randomized text, but once I figured out how to create a "this.image" and just creating a img src within my new classes (objSpawn) it was then a piece of cake. I now understand the usefulness of Object Oriented Programming!
