I could not figure out the logic for most of them, and so could not do some functions that I had my mind set on, such as "mainmessage" fading out when the shapes made contact with each other! Regardless, though simpler then last week's site, made for an appealing game! the organization of functions once again frustrated, so followed, for the most part, along as closely as possible to the example code's function organization. I find the order of functions within js to still be a difficult subject for me. I managed to add a button click function in this assignment, which I felt particularly proud of!
