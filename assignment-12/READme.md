This week was incredibly fun and allowed me to stretch my creativity a bit more. I opted to keep the default character because I 
enjoyed his design and his hat and color scheme fit the colors of the fantasy background I have chosen. aesthetically, this is by far 
my favorite piece I made this semester, although I do wish I could have figured out how to center the game's canvas to make it look nicer. 
My main issue this week was figuring out weather to use local files or a CDN to get the code to function without a live local server,
which was overall a pain in the neck. It seemed a CDN and external plug-in links were the way to go. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the
creative portion of this exercise, but the latter situation, wasn't as much.
