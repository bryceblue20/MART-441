(SCROLL THE MOUSE WHEEL DOWN FROM THE THREE CANVAS'S SIDES TO SCROLL DOWN TO THE TITLE AND TEXT)

This was a rather straightforward assignment, although my biggest issue was trying to add more vertices onto my spheres but anytime 
I attempt to enter vertices and scale information within Three.SphereGeometry(); it would mess with my Moon shape, so unfortunately 
my spheres were rather blocky. I also couldn't quite figure out how to add a material color to my model. Finally, I really wanted to
attempt to resize the Three Canvas so that the bottom title and text underneath was more visible. I tried to remove the pan and zoom
controls,but the only way to view is to scroll off the top and sides of the canvas. I do find this a very intruiging JS language, but 
to me phaser was more enjoyable just because it seems like there is a lot more it could do comparatively then Three, everytime I tried
anything substantial this week the code wouldn't function correctly.
