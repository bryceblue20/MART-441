This week was rather straight forward for me, as several techniques used prior were repeated.However, the difficulties came with figuring out how to get the shapes from the main collidable object JSON to "disappear" once they were collected. After around 4-5 hours of problem solving I finally figured launching them off the canvas through the collision by changing their axis locations off the canvas itself was a clever way to make it seem like they disappeared once collided. This is also the first time I had successfully created an if statement for the score, but due to it clashing with the collider if statements I couldn't get the elements in the score if statement to hide/fadeOut so after the game is complete they are kind of awkwardly still there. Nonetheless, this was a successful expansion upon the techniques learned from last week!
