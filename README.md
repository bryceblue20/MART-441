This week was mostly a stuggle on figuring out which fadeIn,fadeOut, hide, or show jquery functions could work in conjuction with others simultaneously and which ones would keep others from functioning properly. I could not figure out the logic for most of them, and so could not do some functions that I had my mind set on, such as "mainmessage" fading out when the shapes made contact with each other! Regardless, though simpler then last week's site, made for an appealing game! the organization of functions once again frustrated. I find the order of functions within js to still be a difficult subject for me. I managed to add a button click function in this assignment, but did not know how to do anything other then squares for objects, I would love to learn how to perhaps use pngs or learn other kind of shapes to use other then squares!
