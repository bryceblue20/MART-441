My main issue this week was attempting to style the image and table tags into something more but something I couldn't identify was keeping the css I assigned to those areas from functioning. From what I could muster through my work this week something about the script for js and the styles for css being on the same html page was keeping one or the other from fully functioning. I created the html and css areas first but couldn't get the javascript to function no matter what I did so scrapped it and started from scratch, beginning with the javascript first and working around it, which ended up working for me in the end, but still couldn't style the table or anything inside of it, but still managed to make something though not as detailed and professional as last week, but still nice and dynamic all the same, using my favorite css attribute, "transition-duration". I added quite a few more images and rows this week then the example, but if next week (which I already know utilizes this week's js structure somewhat) it begins to get too complicated keeping track of so many rows, I might have to trim it down!
